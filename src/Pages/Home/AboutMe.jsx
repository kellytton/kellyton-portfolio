                        I’ve always been drawn to the idea of breaking things and putting them back together — whether it’s understanding how software works or finding new ways to solve problems with code. I've realized that learning to code isn't about following a set path but more about experimenting, making mistakes, and figuring things out as you go. That process of trial and error, of trying something new and seeing what happens, is what excites me the most about programming.

                        I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at USF, set to graduate in Spring 2025. Over the years, I’ve gained a lot from my coursework and internship, but the most meaningful learning has come from the projects I’ve taken on — from building applications to developing a sentiment analyzer during my internship. I love that with every new challenge, I get to push my boundaries, learn something new, and constantly improve.

                    <p className="hero--section-description">
                        I’m eager to keep breaking things (in the best way possible) and learning from every experience along the way.
